  <h1>Improving WMS Layout</h1>
  <p>WMS Improvement / SQL Understanding</p>
</header>

<div class="project-container">

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project involved improving an existing automated database and table system to enhance
    Warehouse Management System (WMS) workflows. The goal was to reduce operational complexity,
    minimize human error, and bridge the gap between experienced and new warehouse staff by
    consolidating multiple inventory tables into a single, intuitive view.
  </p>

  <h2>My Role & Contributions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Communicated system improvement ideas to a third-party WMS company.</li>
    <li>Tested newly implemented tables and reported bugs and edge cases.</li>
    <li>Collaborated with WMS developers on restructuring inventory tables and SQL-based changes.</li>
    <li>Trained staff on how to use the new table effectively, including workflow tips and best practices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Technologies & Skills Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>SQL (assisted and reviewed database adjustments)</li>
    <li>Data Analysis</li>
    <li>Process Improvement</li>
    <li>Technical Communication</li>
    <li>Problem Solving and Ideas</li>
    <li>Logistics & Warehouse Operations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Outcomes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Consolidated multiple inventory tables into a single unified view.</li>
    <li>Reduced onboarding time for new staff and minimized skill gaps.</li>
    <li>Lowered risk of missed customer items during daily operations.</li>
    <li>Prevented team collisions where multiple staff grabbed the same inventory.</li>
    <li>Improved confidence in inventory accuracy through instant refresh validation.</li>
    <li>Enabled data-driven decision-making for warehouse management.</li>
    <li>People using Inventory Computer can now outspeed/manage 2 fork lifters (before 1 fork lifter outspeed 1 computer)
      or a forklifter can simply do the computer work themselves </li>
  </ul>

  <h2><strong>Thinking, Problem-Solving Process & story</strong></h2>
  <p>
    The big problem was the diffuclties of managing 3 different tables at once:
    1: table used to check every and each pallete if an item/s was needed, 2: to confirm 
    if items were collected and 3: every location of every customer items of the day. 
    This will lead to human error, even below 99% is such a huge margin of error. 
    1 fault can lead to massive delay especially on busy days
    where space on the floor is being/needed to be taken up to open other space, and just missing an item means we
    may have to open one space up to get an item which takes a long period of time.

    So as I was doing my job at the warehouse, I was thinking of a solution and pitched it
    to my boss which she immediately put me on a call with the wms company managing their system.
    A few days later, wms developer and I developed a new SINGLE table capable of doing everything while
    also being much simpler to utilize and speed up the process. There were a lot of variables columns combined, while also
    excluding a lot of unecessary data clogging up the screen. I had to identify everything variable, highlight all important
